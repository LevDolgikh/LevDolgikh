- 👋 Hi, I’m @LevDolgikh.
- 👀 I'm interested in different things, just trying to do what i like to do. 
I dont have any knowledge in computer science and programming, but i just enjoy to do some simple things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics of Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything... Probably no one care... Because I'm currently quite useless.
- 📫 To reach me write me down on my email: peand18@gmail.com.
